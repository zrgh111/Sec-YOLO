# Sec-YOLO
A detection algorithm that detects unsafe behavior
The system can detect four common unsafe behaviors: falling, sleeping on the job, using a mobile phone, and not wearing a safety helmet.
# dataset
The dataset has been uploaded to Zenodo, and its DOI is 10.5281/zenodo.14015767.
# Easy operation
The code can be trained, tested, and generate heatmaps using commands, in line with the official YOLOv8 code. Additionally, train.py, detect.py, and heatmap.py have been created. You can run the programs directly.
